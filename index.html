<p>The Weeknd has become a global sensation as one of the most listened-to artists of the past decade. In truth, his influence reaches further than top-charting singles, with his career trajectory representing a radical shift from his origins. The Weeknd's beginnings in alternative R&B perhaps represent a time where his sound was undiluted by what the larger market leans toward, depending on individuals' perspectives when it comes to "poppified" music. However, his turn to genres with more widespread cultural appeal point to his skill at capturing the attention of people of all musical interests, as well as a lyrical shift that reflects his overall happiness compared to the difficult life he lived before pop stardom.</p>
